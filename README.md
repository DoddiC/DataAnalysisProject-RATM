# DataAnalysisProject-RATM
Data Analysis Project created for UCSC's CSE 146 (Ethics and Algorithms) class.

This project performs general data analysis on a given dataset. The database records all of the recorded NYPD's stop incidences and the details pertaining to each stop. Some of the items recorded include the description of the suspected crime, whether the officer was wearing a uniform, the suspect's demeanor, and the location of the stop and frisks. These incidents are recorded through an app that are then uploaded to the database. Data source: [NYPD's 2019 Stop, Question, and Frisk Database](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)
